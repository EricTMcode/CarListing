## Overview

- Develop a working mobile app
- Use a git repo and share it as we want to see your commits
- You can use our prototype as a reference, but feel free to explore and experiment to have a different look and feel for the UI
- The Challenge will comprised of 3 levels: Level 1 (Beginner), Level 2 for (Intermediate), Level 3 (Advanced)
- Please accomplish as many levels as you are comfortable with. You should only proceed to the next level if the current level has already been completely implemented.
- Do not show any part of the UI if it’s not working. Let’s focus on quality over quantity!

**Level 2 Requirements:**

- Add or implement the expandable card to the list
- By default, the first item should be expanded
- Upon clicking or tapping an item, the previous item will collapse, and the new item will expand.
- Pros and cons sections should be shown.
- Note that there is no limit to the number of bullet points inside the card so these should be added and scaled dynamically.
- Level 2 Reward: Platinum Badge
